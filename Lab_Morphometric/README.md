# Lab materials for morphometric exercise

## Scripts
Today's lab is outlined in [**morphometric_lab.md**](https://github.com/morgan-sparks/FLC_Labs/blob/main/Lab_Morphometric/morphometric_lab.md), well follow along with that as we work through the exercise.

To give you a sense of what else is in this folderL

1. morphometric_lab.Rmd is a Rmarkdown document to outline exercise (what builds the .md file we're working with)
2. morphometric_lab_script.R is the R script to run the analyses for the class exercise (I'll be switching back and forth between the lab and this file throughout today)

## Other materials
The google folder for lab exercises (e.g. data sheet to enter data) is at:

To enter class data, use the `class_data` sheet in that folder
